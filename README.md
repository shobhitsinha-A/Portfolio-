# 🚀 Personal Portfolio Website - [Visit Website](https://shobhitsinha-portfolio.netlify.app/)

Welcome to my personal portfolio website repository! This website showcases my projects, skills, and experience to potential employers and collaborators.

## Overview

This repository contains all the code and assets for my personal portfolio website. It is designed to be responsive and user-friendly across different devices and screen sizes. This is a full-stack responsive portfolio website. For seamless management of my content without altering the codebase, I've employed Sanity.io as the backend. This allows me to effortlessly update my details and projects. On the frontend, I've leveraged JavaScript and React.js to create a dynamic and interactive user interface. To add captivating animations, I integrated Framer Motion, enhancing the website's visual appeal and user experience. With these technologies combined, my portfolio website not only showcases my work effectively but also ensures easy maintenance and a delightful browsing experience for visitors.
